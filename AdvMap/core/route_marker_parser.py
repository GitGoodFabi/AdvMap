# This function will extract the route name and type from the caption.
# It uses regex to find patterns like #boulder:RouteName, #sport:RouteName, and #multi:RouteName.
# The extracted route name and type are returned as a tuple.
# If no match is found, it returns (None, None).
# This is a simple example and can be expanded based on the specific needs of the application.
# The regex patterns can be adjusted to match different formats or additional types of routes.
# The function can also be integrated into a larger application where Instagram captions are processed.
# The extracted route names and types can be stored in a database or used for further processing.
